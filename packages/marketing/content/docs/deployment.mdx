You will need to set the following environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Create an API key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com)
- `ENCRYPT_COLUMN_SECRET`: <SecretGenerator />

After deploying, go to the app URL and follow the instructions to complete setup.

## Other platforms

Helper is a Next.js app, so follow the Next.js deployment guide for your platform of choice.

You will need to set up the following services. The environment variables may be set automatically if your platform has a built-in integration, or you may need to set them manually.

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (set up environment variables for `POSTGRES_URL`, `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
- [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/cloud) (set up environment variables for `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` and `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`)
